# Spear Falling Effect

This is a simple effect where it rains down ice spears from the sky. It's spawned on the player's mouse and uses raycast to check whether the player is aiming at the ground or the air. If aimed at the ground it wont play. When the spear hits the ground a crater will form with a simple particle effect. The material of the rocks will change depending on the terrain the spear lands on.
